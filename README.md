# ab-text-editor
Fall 2014 SWE Project

This was a project for my CS undergraduate Software Engineering course. I worked with five other students over the course of a semester through an entire project lifecycle. We chose to design a text editor in Java for children. It has large, graphical buttons and only very basic functionality. There is a "Teacher Application" which would allow an adult to adjust the configuration of the text editor. The application produces a small text file which the editor reads before starting in order to determine the functionalities that should be available.

The focus of the class wasn't to code something challenging or overly complex; it was just to get a feel for how software development might be done in the real world. I agreed to write the bulk of the code, in exchange for my teammates being responsible for the bulk of the documentation. I also acted as the "client" during the requirements gathering stage of the process. One of my team members was responsible for linking the Jortho library, which is used for the spell checking functionality, and I put together the rest of the application.

The source code is commented, but poorly commented. If I were to code it again, I would include Java doc comments... And more comments in general. The functionalities are extremely simple thanks to the extensive libraries available in Java. Most of them were more or less copied from online examples. (I am however, very proud of "Find" and "Save".) The code is well organized and fairly clean. I'm happy with the result and the resulting application. The class was a great learning experience.

The icons for the buttons were grabbed straight off of Google searches and I don't have a way to properly attribute them. I believe this is legal since this project was non-commercial. If you are the creator or owner of any of these graphics and you would like to be credited or have the image removed, please let me know.

The documentation is available within the "Final Documentation" word document. The document also contains a user guide.

The "Dist" folder contains both the text editor and the teacher application. They're executable Jar files, so no installation is required; just double-click them to run.

I'm releasing this project under the GNU General Public License. It would be cool if the work we did helped anyone in any way.
